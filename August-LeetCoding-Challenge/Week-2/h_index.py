# H-Index

# Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

# According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
  "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

# Example:
  Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
  Output: 3 
  Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
             
# Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

# SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        # O(N) Time and O(N) Space
        n = len(citations)
        bucket = [0] * (n+1)
        for c in citations:
            if c >= n:
                bucket[n] += 1
            else:
                bucket[c] += 1
        count = 0
        for i in range(n+1)[::-1]:
            count += bucket[i]
            if count >= i:
                return i
        return 0
        
        # O(nlogn) Time
        return sum(i < num for i, num in enumerate(sorted(citations, reverse=True)))
