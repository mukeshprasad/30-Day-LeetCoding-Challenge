# Number Complement

# Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
  The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

# Example 1:
  Input: 5
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

# Example 2:
  Input: 1
  Output: 0
  
# Note:
  * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
