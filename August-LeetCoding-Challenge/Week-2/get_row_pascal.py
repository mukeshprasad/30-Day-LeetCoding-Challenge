# Pascal's Triangle II

# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

# Note that the row index starts from 0.

# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

# Example:

  Input: 3
  Output: [1,3,3,1]

# Follow up:
    Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

# SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    def getRowFromPascalTriangle(self, rowIndex: int) -> self:
        # Time -> O(k) <- Space k: rowIndex

        For example, rowIndex = 6. row items are as follows:
        1st: 1=1
        2nd: 6= 6 / 1
        3rd: 15=6x5 / (1x2)
        4th: 20=6x5x4 / (1x2x3)
        5th: 15=6x5x4x3 / (1x2x3x4)
        6th: 6 =6x5x4x3x2 / (1x2x3x4x5)
        7th: 1 =6x5x4x3x2x1 / (1x2x3x4x5x6)
